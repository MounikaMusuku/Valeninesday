    <div class="desc">"It’s our Pappu Annam day! We were two strangers who are now going to spend the rest of our lives together. Our hearts were blank slates, ready to learn about one another, but surprisingly, God made our mentalities exactly the same. As we took this picture, our hearts were beating so fast—perhaps that was the moment our journey truly began."</br> I Love You my heart💕</div>

    <div class="desc">"This is our very first picture together, taken while we were shopping for our engagement outfits. During that time, I fell deeply in love with you because of the way you showered me with so much love, care, and responsibility. My heart is still racing, and I have butterflies in my stomach just thinking about it."</br> I Love You my sweetheart😍</div>

I remember you sharing your whole life story—from Kabaddi and cricket to bank transfers—while I just sat there, listening to you. It was late into the night, but it remains such a memorable day for me."</div>

    <div class="desc">"This was our very first movie date, watching HIT 3. Surprisingly, the hero and heroine were acting just like us—shyly touching hands and stealing glances at each other. My heart was racing the entire time! Since our engagement was already done, it felt like you were officially my 'half-husband.' The freedom, love, and care you show me are unforgettable.

    <div class="desc">"This was our second movie date, and with our wedding just four days away, we couldn't resist. We already know we’ll be together for a lifetime, yet our hearts still didn't want to miss a single chance to meet. The best part? We both felt exactly the same way. The movie was called '#Single'—fittingly, the last movie we'll ever watch while still being single! 🤗😜"</div>

    <div class="desc">"Within just one month, we went from Pappannam to our engagement, and now we are married! They say marriages are made in heaven, and our wedding is the perfect example of that. What more could I ask of God? Marriage is the biggest milestone for a girl, and having you in my life is more than enough for this lifetime. To ask for anything more to god would be selfish, because you are now my everything. I may not always express my feelings perfectly, but I love you more than words can say. I promise to never make you unhappy (except for those late nights! 😇). I will cherish, stand by you and honor you until my last breath. You are truly God's gift to me, and I have fallen—and continue to fall—for your love, care, pure soul and responsibility."</div>

It felt like you were there more for my happiness than your own, and that touched my heart so much. I could feel that you cared more about my enjoyment than anything else. What more could I ask for in life than you? I had the most amazing time with you, and it’s a memory I’ll cherish forever.
